# Chat Room

A server-client network that allows users to communicate with each other no matter where they are located.

The server is able to handle multiple clients/users at once, while properly managing data. The user is able to register, log in, or exit. Once logged in, the users can text or log off.

Each client provides an "easy to use" graphical user interface to its user.
